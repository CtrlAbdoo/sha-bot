# SHA-Bot Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup changes made to the SHA-Bot project to eliminate redundancy, improve organization, and ensure consistency across the codebase.

## Files Removed

1. **Redundant Configuration Files**:
   - `config/requirements.txt` - Merged with the root `requirements.txt`
   - Removed `config` directory

2. **Redundant Batch and Shell Scripts**:
   - `bin/run_simulation.bat` - Functionality now in `main.py --train`
   - `bin/start_finetuned_api.bat` - Functionality now in `main.py --run`

3. **Duplicate Documentation**:
   - `docs/README.md` - Duplicate of root `README.md`
   - `docs/GITHUB_README.md` - Now integrated into main documentation

4. **Moved Files**:
   - `test_bot.py` - Moved from root to `tests/` directory for better organization

## Files Updated

1. **Package Management**:
   - Updated `requirements.txt` to include all dependencies from both files
   - Updated all scripts to reference the root `requirements.txt` file

2. **Documentation**:
   - Updated `README.md` to remove references to deleted files
   - Updated references in all documentation to point to the correct paths
   - Updated script paths in various guides

3. **Scripts**:
   - Updated `bin/start_api.bat` and `bin/start_api.sh` to use the root `requirements.txt`

## Project Structure Changes

1. **Simplified Directory Structure**:
   - Removed empty `config` directory
   - Streamlined `bin` directory to contain only essential scripts
   - Improved test organization by moving all test files to the `tests` directory

## Benefits

1. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Single source of truth for dependencies
   - Reduced duplication in documentation and scripts
   - Clearer file organization

2. **Simplified Deployment**:
   - Render.com deployment uses a single, consistent configuration
   - Dependencies are maintained in one place

3. **Better Developer Experience**:
   - Clearer documentation with less redundancy
   - Consistent paths and references
   - Command-line interface through `main.py` provides a unified way to interact with the application

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for deployment to Render.com. The cleanup ensures that the application follows best practices for organization and maintainability.
